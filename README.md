# 🏡 House Price Prediction with Linear Regression

This project is part of my virtual internship at Prodigy InfoTech, under the Machine Learning domain. The task focuses on using Linear Regression to predict housing prices using the Kaggle House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques dataset.

---

## 📌 Task Overview

- Goal: Predict house prices using linear regression.
- Dataset: [House Prices - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)
- Files Used: `train.csv`, `test.csv`, `sample_submission.csv`, `data_description.txt`
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `sklearn`

---

## 🧠 Features Selected

- `GrLivArea`: Ground living area (sq ft)
- `BedroomAbvGr`: Bedrooms above ground
- `FullBath`: Full bathrooms above ground
- `TotRmsAbvGrd`: Total rooms above ground (excl. bathrooms)
- `OverallQual`: Overall material/finish quality
- `GarageCars`: Number of cars that can fit in garage
- `YearBuilt`: Year of construction

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metric

- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) on validation set.
- Simple model visualization using a scatter plot (actual vs predicted).

---

## ✅ Results

- Trained a basic linear regression model.
- Achieved reasonable performance using selected engineered features.
- Prepared a submission file (`submission.csv`) following Kaggle's format.

## 📁 Files in Repo

- `task1_house_price_prediction.ipynb` — Full Google Colab code
- `train.csv`, `test.csv`, etc. — Dataset files (locally uploaded for execution)
- `submission.csv` — Output file generated from the model

---

## 📌 How to Run

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab.
2. Upload the dataset files manually or mount Google Drive.
3. Run all cells to train the model and generate predictions.
